"Hyperledger Fabric is an implementation of distributed ledger technology "
"(DLT) that delivers enterprise-ready network security, scalability, "
"confidentiality and performance, in a modular blockchain architecture. "
"Hyperledger Fabric delivers the following blockchain network "

msgid "Identity management"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/functionalities.rst:12
msgid ""
"To enable permissioned networks, Hyperledger Fabric provides a membership"
" identity service that manages user IDs and authenticates all "
"participants on the network. Access control lists can be used to provide "
"additional layers of permission through authorization of specific network"
" operations. For example, a specific user ID could be permitted to invoke"
" a chaincode application, but be blocked from deploying new chaincode."

#: ../../source/functionalities.rst:22
msgid ""
"Hyperledger Fabric enables competing business interests, and any groups "
"that require private, confidential transactions, to coexist on the same "
"permissioned network. Private **channels** are restricted messaging paths"
" that can be used to provide transaction privacy and confidentiality for "
"specific subsets of network members. All data, including transaction, "
"member and channel information, on a channel are invisible and "
"inaccessible to any network members not explicitly granted access to that"
" channel."

msgid "Efficient processing"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/functionalities.rst:33
msgid ""
"Hyperledger Fabric assigns network roles by node type. To provide "
"concurrency and parallelism to the network, transaction execution is "
"separated from transaction ordering and commitment. Executing "
"transactions prior to ordering them enables each peer node to process "
"multiple transactions simultaneously. This concurrent execution increases"
" processing efficiency on each peer and accelerates delivery of "
"transactions to the ordering service."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/functionalities.rst:40
msgid ""
"In addition to enabling parallel processing, the division of labor "
"unburdens ordering nodes from the demands of transaction execution and "
"ledger maintenance, while peer nodes are freed from ordering (consensus) "
"workloads. This bifurcation of roles also limits the processing required "
"for authorization and authentication; all peer nodes do not have to trust"
" all ordering nodes, and vice versa, so processes on one can run "
"independently of verification by the other."

msgid "Chaincode functionality"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/functionalities.rst:51
msgid ""
"Chaincode applications encode logic that is invoked by specific types of "
"transactions on the channel. Chaincode that defines parameters for a "
"change of asset ownership, for example, ensures that all transactions "
"that transfer ownership are subject to the same rules and requirements. "
"**System chaincode** is distinguished as chaincode that defines operating"
" parameters for the entire channel. Lifecycle and configuration system "
"chaincode defines the rules for the channel; endorsement and validation "
"system chaincode defines the requirements for endorsing and validating "
"transactions."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/functionalities.rst:63
msgid ""
"Hyperledger Fabric implements a modular architecture to provide "
"functional choice to network designers. Specific algorithms for identity,"
" ordering (consensus) and encryption, for example, can be plugged in to "
"any Hyperledger Fabric network. The result is a universal blockchain "
"architecture that any industry or public domain can adopt, with the "
"assurance that its networks will be interoperable across market, "
"regulatory and geographic boundaries."
