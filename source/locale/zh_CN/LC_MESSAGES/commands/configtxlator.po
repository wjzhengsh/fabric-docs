"The configtxlator command allows users to translate between protobuf and "
"JSON versions of fabric data structures and create config updates.  The "
"command may either start a REST server to expose its functions over HTTP "
"or may be utilized directly as a command line tool."

"The tool name is a portmanteau of configtx and translator and is intended"
" to convey that the tool simply converts between different equivalent "
"data representations. It does not generate configuration. It does not "
"submit or retrieve configuration. It does not modify configuration "
"itself, it simply provides some bijective operations between different "
"views of the configtx format."

#: ../../source/commands/configtxlator.md:154
msgid ""
"There is no configuration file configtxlator nor any authentication or "
"authorization facilities included for the REST server.  Because "
"configtxlator does not have any access to data, key material, or other "
"information which might be considered sensitive, there is no risk to the "
"owner of the server in exposing it to other clients.  However, because "
"the data sent by a user to the REST server might be confidential, the "
"user should either trust the administrator of the server, run a local "
"instance, or operate via the CLI."
