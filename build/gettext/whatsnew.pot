msgid "Hyperledger Fabric's First long term support release"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/whatsnew.rst:7
msgid "Hyperledger Fabric has matured since the initial v1.0 release, and so has the community of Fabric operators. The Fabric developers have been working with network operators to deliver v1.4 with a focus on stability and production operations. As such, v1.4 will be our first long term support release."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/whatsnew.rst:12
msgid "Our policy to date has been to provide bug fix (patch) releases for our most recent major or minor release until the next major or minor release has been published. We plan to continue this policy for subsequent releases. However, for Hyperledger Fabric v1.4, the Fabric maintainers are pledging to provide bug fixes for a period of one year from the date of release. This will likely result in a series of patch releases (v1.4.1, v1.4.2, â€¦), where multiple fixes are bundled into a patch release."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/whatsnew.rst:20
msgid "If you are running with Hyperledger Fabric v1.4, you can be assured that you will be able to safely upgrade to any of the subsequent patch releases. In the advent that there is need of some upgrade process to remedy a defect, we will provide that process with the patch release."

msgid "Serviceability and operations improvements"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/whatsnew.rst:28
msgid "As more Hyperledger Fabric networks get deployed and enter a production state, serviceability and operational aspects are critical. Fabric v1.4 takes a giant leap forward with logging improvements, health checks, and operational metrics. As such, Fabric v1.4 is the recommended release for production operations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/whatsnew.rst:34
msgid ":doc:`operations_service`: The new RESTful operations service provides operators with three services to monitor and manage peer and orderer node operations:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/whatsnew.rst:38
msgid "The logging ``/logspec`` endpoint allows operators to dynamically get and set logging levels for the peer and orderer nodes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/whatsnew.rst:41
msgid "The ``/healthz`` endpoint allows operators and container orchestration services to check peer and orderer node liveness and health."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/whatsnew.rst:44
msgid "The ``/metrics`` endpoint allows operators to utilize Prometheus to pull operational metrics from peer and orderer nodes. Metrics can also be pushed to StatsD."

msgid "Improved programming model for developing applications"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/whatsnew.rst:50
msgid "Writing decentralized applications has just gotten easier. Programming model improvements in the Node.js SDK and Node.js chaincode makes the development of decentralized applications more intuitive, allowing you to focus on your application logic. The existing npm packages are still available for use, while the new npm packages provide a layer of abstraction to improve developer productivity and ease of use."
