msgid "When we use the term “upgrade” in this documentation, we’re primarily referring to changing the version of a component (for example, going from a v1.3 binary to a v1.4 binary). The term “update,” on the other hand, refers not to versions but to configuration changes, such as updating a channel configuration or a deployment script. As there is no data migration, technically speaking, in Fabric, we will not use the term \"migration\" or \"migrate\" here."
