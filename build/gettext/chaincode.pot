msgstr ""

#: ../../source/chaincode.rst:7
msgid "Chaincode is a program, written in `Go <https://golang.org>`_, `node.js <https://nodejs.org>`_, or `Java <https://java.com/en/>`_ that implements a prescribed interface. Chaincode runs in a secured Docker container isolated from the endorsing peer process. Chaincode initializes and manages ledger state through transactions submitted by applications."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/chaincode.rst:13
msgid "A chaincode typically handles business logic agreed to by members of the network, so it may be considered as a \"smart contract\". State created by a chaincode is scoped exclusively to that chaincode and can't be accessed directly by another chaincode. However, within the same network, given the appropriate permission a chaincode may invoke another chaincode to access its state."

msgid "We offer two different perspectives on chaincode. One, from the perspective of an application developer developing a blockchain application/solution entitled :doc:`chaincode4ade`, and the other, :doc:`chaincode4noah` oriented to the blockchain network operator who is responsible for managing a blockchain network, and who would leverage the Hyperledger Fabric API to install, instantiate, and upgrade chaincode, but would likely not be involved in the development of a chaincode application."
